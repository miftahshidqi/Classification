# Classification

  I have been given the datasets, they are named "kendaraan_train.csv" and "kendaraan_test.csv". So my job is do classification based on given datasets to predict customer interest on buying new vehicle. So i trained 3 models based on "kendaraan_train.csv" dataset, each model using different calssification method. First model using Logistic Regression, second model using K-Nearest_Neigbhor, Third model using tpot. For Your Information, Tpot is one of Auto Machine Learning tools that can choose the best Machine Learning (ML) method on accuracy by itself, so we do not have to mess around with which the best ML method on given dataset, just let tpot do the job. And after i trained those models, i test those models using "kendaraan_test.csv" dataset to make sure the model that has been built is good to use.
